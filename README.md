## Introduction

### NumPy
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently.

### Pandas
Pandas is an open-source data manipulation and analysis library built on top of NumPy. It provides data structures like Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame (2-dimensional) that are highly efficient for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Key features of Pandas:
- Data wrangling and manipulation
- Handling missing data
- Merging and joining datasets
- Reshaping data
- Powerful time-series capabilities
- Easy data visualization
